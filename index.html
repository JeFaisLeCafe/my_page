    <div class="about-me">
      <p>I'm a 23 years old guy living in Paris. I come from Lyon, so of course I love gastronomy as well as ‚õ∑Ô∏è in winter. I'm also a üõ©Ô∏è pilot, a rugby player, and an esport/video-games person. I enjoy reading heroic-fantasy and SF, music (I play some üéπ), and discussion-nights with friends. I üó£Ô∏è fluently French and English, correctly German, and a bit of Russian. </p>
      <p class="catchphrase">I'm a very passionate guy, and I love to be part of ambitious projects !</p>

        <h2>My Work Experiences</h2>
        <p>Safran (industry): security engineer assistant on a production facility and as technical production support. I learnt the needs of a 24/7 uninterrupted production line, as well as the importance of a secure environment.</p>
        <p>BPLL (bank): agency's director assistant and welcoming manager. I learnt about the loan business, the money exanges and how big companies follow their clients.</p>
        <p>Vivens (insurance): I developped tools to help track their employees' performance, insure service's quality and manage client issues. I learnt there about quality indices and client satisfaction, and it was also a first experience working with a designer.</p>

        <h2>My Projects & Interests</h2>
        <p>As a person, competition is a drive I understand; that's why I've created (and been president for 2 years) in my uni an esport association, to promote competition in video-games, managing teams and represent my school in different events. This appetite for esport is still there, and whenever I get to work with something related to this, I'm always excited and informed about the industry.</p>
        <p>Esport: Competition on video-games. I've created and been president for 2 years of an esport association on my campus. </p>
        <p>I'm also a very curious person. I'm excited about new techno, like the progress with AI, and the usage of big datas. I'm not trained in this field, but I'm eager to learn and would love to integrate that in a project.</p>

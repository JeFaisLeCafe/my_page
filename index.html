I also enjoy plane piloting, playing rugby  and esport/video-games. I like reading heroic-fantasy and SF, music (I play piano ), and have evening discussions with my friends. </p>

        <h2>My Work Experiences</h2>
        <p><strong>Safran</strong> (industry): security engineer assistant on a production facility and as technical production support. I learnt the needs of a 24/7 uninterrupted production line, as well as the importance of a secure environment.</p>

        <h2>My Projects & Interests</h2>
        <p><strong>Esport:</strong> Competition on video-games. I've created and been president for 2 years of an esport association on my campus. Managing over 50 members, many teams on different games and allowing them to represent us in national events made me take impactful decision and taught me a lot about leading. I'm still eager to work in this field</p>
        <p><strong>AI:</strong> I'm a curious person. I'm excited about new technos, like the growing possibilities of AI, and the usage of big datas. I'm not trained in this field, but I'm eager to learn and would love to integrate that in a project.</p>
